                <p>Neuroscientists compare our brains to a vast and wild meadow. The first footprints in this meadow are left behind in the womb, soon to be turned into trails and paths. The more we move on in life and the more often we perform a certain task, the more we internalize and strengthen those pathways until one day, those tracks become super-efficient highways. Almost effortlessly, we press the right buttons and work our way through our evolving, maturing lives.</p>
                <p>This is all fine, until conditions or circumstances change and well-established tools suddenly fail to achieve the expected results.</p>
                <p>Autonomous driving, AI, VR and Microplastic are just a few of the key components with potential to act as game changers in both private and business life.</p>
                <p>My goal is to help you see things from a different perspective in order to develop innovative, problem-solving strategies. How? By breaking well-known patterns of movement and teaching you new ones. By pushing you out of your comfort zone, and by reactivating forgotten sensory input.</p>

                  <p>Born in 1978 in Heidelberg, studying Industrial Design in Munich brought me closer to the mountains. Constant river surfing prepared me for surf trips around the globe. The ten years spent working as a product manager for the world’s leading company of avalanche security systems and kitesurfing equipment taught me how to turn ideas into products, as well as make me aware of the difficulties of bringing visions and business together. Numerous meetings and business trips to Asia offered me insights into different personality types, problem-solving techniques and work ethics.
